## Code Requirements



### Coding Style

We use the [`Ruff` linter / formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) for all Python files.
To install the latest version of Ruff, use the following command:


```bash
pip install ruff
```

**Linting:** To check your files for compliance with our coding standards, run the following command:

```bash
ruff check 
```

This command will analyze the specified directory and report any issues that need to be addressed.

**Formatting:** To automatically format your files according to our coding standards, use:

```bash
ruff format 
```

This command will apply the necessary formatting changes to ensure consistency across the codebase.
